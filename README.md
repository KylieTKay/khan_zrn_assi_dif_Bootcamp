It will showcase the Level 4 students' portfolios, highlighting their creative skills and accomplishments. Additionally, the website will provide essential details about the Industry Night event, such as the date and location, offering a comprehensive resource for users to learn about the program and stay updated on this exciting networking opportunity. Through this digital presence, we aim to foster a bridge between students and the industry, facilitating connections and opportunities for collaboration and career development.
